# Fireworks Reimagined Settings

# Performance Settings
fireworks_auto_performance_adjust (Enable automatic performance adjustment) bool true

# When enabled, the mod will automatically adjust firework quality based on server performance.
# This helps maintain smooth gameplay by reducing particle counts and effects when the server
# is under heavy load or has many players online.
# 
# When disabled, fireworks will always use the configured quality level without automatic changes.
# Server administrators can still manually adjust quality using chat commands.
